# Classroom-Refolder

When using Google Classroom, I had some trouble id each student's work. So I thought it was a good idea to make a personal folder for each student in each appointment.
This way, when I download the appointment folder in a zip, I don't lose the student's identity.

## Config 
Use the .gs and for activators, use 2: `unStarModified()` first, and some hours later `main()`.
 
 You must config the 3 variables in the code: 
 - `TEACHERS` : an array with the teachers mails.
 - `FOLDERID` : the classroom drive folder id.
 - `FOLDERNAME` : the name of the folder that will be created inside each appointment folder. This is the folder you will download as .zip.
 
## Notes
Sorry for my mistakes, I am relatively new to Google App Scripts.
You can contact me if you have any doubt.
