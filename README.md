# Classroom-Refolder
For Google Classroom I have some toubles identifying a student work, so I decide it to make a folder for each student in each appointment.
That is how I can download all the appointment folder in a zip without lossing the student identity.

## Config 
Use the .gs and for activators, use 2: `unStarModified()` first, and some hours later `main()`.
 
 You must config the 3 variables in the code: 
 - `TEACHERS` : an array with the teachers mails.
 - `FOLDERID` : the classroom drive folder id.
 - `FOLDERNAME` : the name of the folder that will be created inside each appointment folder. This is the folder you will download as .zip.
